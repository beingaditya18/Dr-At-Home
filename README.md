# 🧑‍⚕️ Doctor At Home 🩺

**Doctor At Home** is an AI-powered medical diagnosis assistant built using **Flask**, **Machine Learning**, and **Google Gemini AI**. Based on user-selected symptoms, the app predicts possible diseases using three ML models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes) and provides AI-generated insights, medical precautions, and specialist suggestions.


## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **Disease Prediction** using:
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Naive Bayes
- 🤖 **Google Gemini AI Integration** for detailed medical insights
- 🧾 **Precautionary Measures** & **Recommended Specialists**
- 🖥️ Clean and interactive web interface for symptom selection
- ✅ Works with `.csv` datasets for training/testing
- ⚠ Disclaimer message for non-professional diagnosis

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. 🔧 Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install flask scikit-learn pandas numpy python-dotenv google-generativeai
````

### 2. 🔑 Add Gemini API Key

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
```

### 3. ▶️ Run the App

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Input Symptoms**: Users select symptoms from a checklist.
2. **Prediction Models**:

   * Three ML models predict the most probable disease.
3. **Precaution Info**:

   * Disease-specific precautions and recommended doctors are shown.
4. **Gemini AI Insights**:

   * Gemini AI provides causes, treatments, and further details for the predicted disease.

## 🧠 Models Used

* `DecisionTreeClassifier`
* `RandomForestClassifier`
* `GaussianNB`

All models are trained on `Training.csv` and validated using `Testing.csv`.
